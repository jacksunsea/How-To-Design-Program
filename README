这个代码库中放着How To Design Program的练习以及自己得一些想法，
第一次接触FP,也是第一次接触Scheme，感觉和原来所接触到的完全是两个不同得世界
这个世界更注重思想，函数是那么的自然，语言是那么得简单而美丽，深深的被FP震撼到了！
呵呵，希望感兴趣得人能一交流
保持初心，stay hungry staty foolish

This repo is about Scheme
I start with <How To Design Program>.
Most of the code are Excercises of every chapter
and some of my thoughts about scheme and FP.
hope it can help you understand something.
I really enjoy programming with scheme.
it totally is a differnt world.you can forget all the things you have learned before.
imagine this is the first time you learn to program!
